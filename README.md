# adss
Angular Distance Sample Selection

This code implements the algorithm published in the paper "Sample selection via angular distance in the space of the arguments of an artificial neural network". plublished in the journal: Computers and Geosciences. Authors: José Manuel Fernández Jaramillo and Roberto Mayerle.

The python module adss contains one function adss that select the samples to be provided to an ANN based in the angular distance among available samples. The main part of the code allows to test the method by a syntetic sample set.
